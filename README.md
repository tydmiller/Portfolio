# Portfolio
Hello and welcome to my portfolio. This portfolio displays my talents in the field of computer graphics. 
I am skilled in C++, OpenGL, Vulkan, GLSL, and 3D modeling/CAD. This includes a couple of games that I have made and some of my custom game engine examples and other project I have worked on
