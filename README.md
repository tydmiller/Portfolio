# Portfolio
Hello and welcome to my portfolio. This portfolio displays my talents in the field of computer graphics and other engineering projects I work on in my past time. 
This includes a couple of games that I have made and some of my custom game engine examples. I am skilled in C++, C, OpenGL, GLSL, Vulkan, SPV, and 3D modeling/CAD. I am currently learning how to develop on bare metal with C.

**Software Engineer:**

Here are some images from my custom engine I made at DigiPen:

3D Renderer using Vulkan and OpenGL:

This project loads in STL and OBJ files and then displays them based on vertices coordinates given. I have provided my class for loading STL files as an example. Supports both Vulkan and OpenGL with a GLFW interface to manage the window.

Bare Metal C on Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W:

This turns on a LED light then turns it off. This was acheived using C and the BCM2837 assembly code.
